# Framework for ML in Finance

## ðŸ“š Background
Machine learning needs in the **finance** field: Machine learning algorithms can be used in many aspects such as risk management, asset management, market analysis and trading strategies, and have become a key tool in the field of finance and trading.
### Goals and Significance
#### Goals
* Develop a custom Python machine learning framework
* Intergrate basic machine learning algorithms implemented through packages such as numpy
* Evaluate the algorithms in a variety of financial scenarios
#### Significance
* Develop a machine learning framework for the financial field to provide solutions more suitable for financial problems instead of just relying on general machine learning libraries
* A framework for machine learning beginners to quickly get started with basic machine learning algorithms

## ðŸ“ˆ Applications
- Risk Management.
Risk management is xxx, can be considered as a xxx task in machine learning. We 

## ðŸŽ® Machine learning Algorithms
- SVM, that can tackle the classification problem, can be applied to the (one of the applications).

## ðŸŽ¬ Demo
Here is a demo of using svm on the netflix stock dataset to do finance prediction.

## Setup
- Install.
```bash
pip install -i requirements.txt
```

## Run
- Init weight.
Create a model config yaml file under `./config/`, which indicate the initial weight name and value of the model. Examples can be found in the existing config directory.
- Write the bash command under `./scripts/`. Examples can be found in the existing config directory.
```bash
bash scripts/run_svm.sh
```
During running, you need to enter natural language that describe how you would like to preprocess the data. After model training, you also need to enter the evaluation metric and the visualization method you would use.
